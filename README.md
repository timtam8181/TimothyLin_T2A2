## Installment steps:

### R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.
I am building this app to assist tourists plan out their holiday when they visit Melbourne. The problem is that when travelling, it can be stressful to plan out where to stay, visit and eat delicious local food. Tourists do not have a means to store all the information in one location and not only that, they do not have an idea of what to do or where to go for some recommendations!

By utilising this app, tourists will be able to receive recommendations if they are at a loss for finding a hotel, activities to do or places to eat. On top of that, they can put their plans into a consolidated set of daily plans, which will map out their visit to Melbourne.

### R2 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?
It is a problem that needs solving because as a tourist, visiting Melbourne for the first time, it is hard to know where are the best places to visit, to eat and hotels to stay. Additionally, to prevent confusion, there needs to be one place to store all this information as well as get some recommendations. 
- **Complicated:** Travel planning for a foreign location is very complicated. There are many different variables to consider such as picking activities, accommodation, restaurants to try. This app aims to simplify things by providing a centralised platform to create, update and manage their plans.  
- **Time wastage:** People are busy. When planning a trip, do not want to nor do they have time to spend countless hours scouring through different blogs, magazines, books to find the information required to visit. This API condenses all the information and makes it available to the user, saving time and effort.
- **Enhanced experience:** With a lack of information, people may not visit attractions that they would otherwise enjoy. Or, with the lack of planning, they may even run out of time to do things they would like to do. This can lead to deep regret and unfathomable sadness. This API alleviates these problems.
